  Traditional clothing in India is highly diverse, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage, geography, climate, and rural or urban settings. For women, popular draped garments include the sari and mekhela sador, while men often wear the dhoti, lungi, or panche (in Kannada). Stitched garments are also common, such as the churidar or salwar-kameez for women, often paired with a dupatta (long scarf). The salwar is typically loose-fitting, while the churidar is more form-fitting. In Punjab, the dastar (a headgear) is a significant part of Sikh attire.

Indian women enhance their beauty and fashion sense with makeup and ornaments, including bindi, mehendi, earrings, bangles, and other jewelry. Special occasions like marriage ceremonies and festivals see women donning vibrant colors and various ornaments made of gold, silver, or regional stones and gems. The bindi, traditionally worn on the forehead, is considered an auspicious mark by many Hindus. Traditionally, a red bindi signified a married Hindu woman, while colored bindis were worn by single women. Today, bindis of all colors and styles are part of women's fashion. Sindoor, a traditional red or orange-red powder, is worn by married Hindu women in the parting of their hair as a sign of their marital status.

Makeup and clothing styles vary regionally and between different Hindu communities, and are also influenced by climate and religion. Christians in India often prefer Western styles, while Muslims may lean towards Arabic styles. For men, traditional stitched clothing includes the kurta-pyjama, while European-style trousers and shirts are also common. In urban and semi-urban areas, men and women of all religious backgrounds frequently wear modern fashions such as jeans, trousers, shirts, suits, and kurtas.
