  India's literary tradition is rich and varied, reflecting its long history and diverse cultures. The Sanskrit language, one of the oldest and most significant, has influenced many Indian languages. Sanskrit, with its intricate structure and vocabulary, was discovered by early European explorers to have strong similarities with classical European languages, leading to the development of comparative philology. Sanskrit is part of the Indo-European language family, which includes English, German, and Latin.

The Rigvedic Sanskrit is one of the earliest attestations of Indo-Aryan languages and one of the oldest Indo-European languages. Its discovery led to intensive studies establishing that many Indian languages are related to European languages.

Tamil, a major classical language of India, descends from Proto-Dravidian languages spoken around the third millennium BCE. Tamil literature dates back over two thousand years, with the earliest inscriptions found on pottery dating to 500 BCE.

India's language evolution can be divided into old, middle, and modern Indo-Aryan periods. The classical form of old Indo-Aryan is Sanskrit, which evolved into middle Indo-Aryan languages such as Pali, Prakrit, and Apabhramsa. These eventually developed into modern languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, and Marathi.

The influence of Sanskrit extends to modern Indian languages and literature. Hindi, the most spoken language in India, is a "Sanskritised register" of the Delhi dialect. Modern Indo-Aryan languages, Munda languages, and Dravidian languages have borrowed extensively from Sanskrit. For instance, Sanskrit-derived words constitute roughly fifty percent of the vocabulary of modern Indo-Aryan languages and the literary forms of Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada.

Kannada, another major classical Dravidian language, has a history of over 2000 years. It is attested epigraphically from the mid-1st millennium AD, with literary Old Kannada flourishing during the 9th to 10th centuries.

Odia, India's 6th classical language, has been significant to Indian culture since ancient times, evidenced by its presence in Ashoka's Rock Edict X, dated to the 2nd century BCE.

Hindi and its dialects have the largest number of speakers in India. Modern standard Hindi developed from Middle Indo-Aryan vernaculars and was influenced by Persian during Islamic rule, leading to the development of Urdu.

Indian English literature developed during the British Raj, with pioneers like Rabindranath Tagore, Mulk Raj Anand, and Munshi Premchand.

In addition to Indo-European and Dravidian languages, India is home to Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman languages. According to the 2011 Linguistic Survey of India, the country has over 780 languages and 66 different scripts, with Arunachal Pradesh alone having 90 languages.</p>
