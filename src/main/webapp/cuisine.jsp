  Indian food, celebrated for its incredible diversity, reflects the vast array of ingredients, cooking techniques, and culinary traditions across the country. From vegetarian dishes to meat-based curries, from intricate spices to mouthwatering desserts, Indian cuisine is known for its complexity and richness. Harold McGee, a renowned food writer, notes India's unmatched inventiveness with milk. Chef Atul Kochhar, the first Indian to receive two Michelin stars, praises India's culinary diversity, remarking that each state has its own unique cuisine, making Indian food a cosmopolitan cuisine with numerous influences. Sanjeev Kapoor, a member of Singapore Airlines' International Culinary Panel, highlights the meticulous planning and cooking of Indian meals, as documented in the 12th-century text Mānasollāsa. Indian cuisine varies regionally, with northern, southern, eastern, western, and northeastern styles, each characterized by unique spices, herbs, and cooking techniques. While vegetarian dishes are prominent, Indian cuisine also includes a variety of meats and seafood, especially in coastal states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Sweets, or mithai, have a long history in India, with sugar production dating back to 500 BCE. Despite the regional diversity, common threads include the extensive use of spices and the influence of historical cultural interactions, such as those with Central Asians, Arabs, Mughals, and European colonists. Indian cuisine's global popularity is evident in dishes like chicken tikka masala, which has become a national dish in the UK. Indian restaurants worldwide often feature Punjabi cuisine, though regional variations are gaining recognition. The historical spice trade significantly impacted global exploration, leading to the Age of Discovery. Modern Indian cuisine continues to evolve, blending traditional and contemporary cooking methods. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana's cuisines, for example, combine Telugu and Hyderabadi influences, with a balance of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, liberal use of spices and souring agents like tamarind, and a staple diet centered around rice.
