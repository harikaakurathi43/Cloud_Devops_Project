   The traditional joint family system in India, where extended family members live together under one roof, has been a long-standing social structure. Typically, the oldest male member acts as the head, making crucial decisions for the family. This setup fostered strong familial bonds and mutual support.

However, the current economic landscape, particularly in metropolitan areas, has shifted preferences toward nuclear families. High living costs, modern lifestyles, and the necessity for both spouses to work make it challenging to maintain the joint family system. The trend towards nuclear families has altered the traditional family headship, with older males often living alone and more vulnerable than before.

Historical analysis by Orenstein and Micklin in 1966 indicated that Indian household sizes were stable from 1911 to 1951. However, urbanization and economic development subsequently led to a shift from joint to nuclear families. Sinha's research over the past 60 years corroborates this trend, noting that while joint families have become less common, they still exist in certain regions and conditions due to cultural and practical reasons.

Youth from lower socio-economic backgrounds tend to spend more time with their families compared to their urban counterparts, reflecting differing parenting ideologies. Additionally, with increased education and economic growth, the joint-family system is rapidly declining, and societal attitudes towards working women have evolved significantly.
